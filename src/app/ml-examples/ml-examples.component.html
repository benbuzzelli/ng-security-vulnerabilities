        <p>Why we use skews</p>
        <p>
          The skews are there to help users find a middle ground of how vulnerable they think their github 
          repo could be. With the different skews having a different amount non vulnerable to vulnerable github reports 
          the ML will be able to give you a more precise evaluation.

        <p>
          For the ML models that we have tried it varies from a nueral netowrl, to a forest models. 
          With these models we are trying to see if either a supervised or unsupervised model will 
          yield any different results.

      <div class="accordion__content">
        <p>Section #3</p>
        <p>
          From one of our ML models its seems like it for sure has seen a difference between a good
          and bad commit.
